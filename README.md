# My Portfolio

Portfolio for myself. Created it to gather information about me and my
projects to one place.

Built with minimal set of languages.
I wanted to stretch my abilities and develop my skills
with no frameworks using only HTML, CSS, & a pinch of JQuery.
Everything is designed and built from scratch by me.

User interface is designed to be modern and minimalistic (even brutalistic), yet informative.
